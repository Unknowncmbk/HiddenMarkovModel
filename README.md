HiddenMarkovModel
=================

Python implementation of a Hidden Markov Model part of speech tagger. The purpose of a HMM is to compute, given the parameters of the model, the probability of a particular output sequence. 

In this project, there exists a tag set document that is used to train the HMM model on the given data. We can use this HMM to predict queries on specific data.

Note that it is not possible to predict the probability of an observation/query by only seeing an arbitrary observations.
